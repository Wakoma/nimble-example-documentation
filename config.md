#  Your Nimble Configuration

You nimble configuration includes a [printed rack and shelf system](printing.md){step}

Your shelves from bottom to to are:

* [SSD shelf](ssd_shelf.md){step} - For your storage drive
* [USB power shelf](usb_shelf.md){step} - To expose a number of USB ports for power
* [NUC shelf](nuctall_shelf.md){step} - For a tall NUC form factor computer
* [Netgate shelf](netgate_shelf.md){step} - For a Netgate 1100 firewall appliance
* [Switch shelf](switch_shelf.md){step} - For a UniFi flex switch

Once you have assembled each shelf, you will [construct the rack](construction.md){step} and [prepare the case](case.md){step} before finally [wiring up the system](wiring.md){step} and [setting it up](setup.md){step}.

Make sure you have [all the parts you need]{bom}, before you start assembly.
